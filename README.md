# autopsychometrics
I strive to create an R package with Shiny GUI that takes questionaire scales as input and automatically applies relevant psychometric indicators and provides the user with text interpretation of those indicators.

## Development roadmap
1. Setup repository and create files
2. Enable Shiny app to load, validate and display psychometric scale data
3. Add core functionality: reliability analysis using the psych package
-- automated APA style formated text interpretation of the results
-- suggestions for improvement of the scale
-- enable user to remove items from analysis and reanalyse without them, also add user specification of settings for the reliability analysis
4. Improve user interface
5. Test the "minimal viable product", ask others for suggestions
6. Depending on time left, add other features, like discrimination analysis, factor analysis or selected IRT models
